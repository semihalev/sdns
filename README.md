## Flags

| Flag              | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -c, --config PATH | Location of the config file. If it doesn't exist, a new one will be generated  |
| -v, --version     | Show the SDNS version                                                          |
| -h, --help        | Show help information and exit                                                 |

## Debugging Environment

To debug your environment, execute the following command:

```shell
$ export SDNS_DEBUGNS=true && export SDNS_PPROF=true && ./sdns
```

The `SDNS_DEBUGNS` environment variable is beneficial for verifying the RTT (Round Trip Time) of authoritative servers. To use it, send an HINFO query for zones with chaos class.

Here's an example of the output you might receive:

```shell
$ dig chaos hinfo example.com

; <<>> DiG 9.17.1 <<>> chaos hinfo example.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 29636

## Plugin Configuration

SDNS supports custom plugins to extend its functionality. The execution order of plugins and middlewares affects their behavior. Configuration keys must be strings, while values can be any type. Plugins are loaded before the cache middleware in the order specified.

For implementation details, see the [example plugin](https://github.com/semihalev/sdnsexampleplugin).

### Example Configuration

```toml
[plugins]
     [plugins.example]
     path = "/path/to/exampleplugin.so"
     config = {key_1 = "value_1", intkey = 2, boolkey = true, keyN = "nnn"}
     [plugins.another]
     path = "/path/to/anotherplugin.so"
```

### Benchmark Results

| Resolver | Version | QPS    | Avg Latency | Lost Queries | Runtime  | Response Codes                                      |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| SDNS     | 1.5.1   | 712/s  | 136ms       | 2 (0.004%)   | 70.2s    | NOERROR: 67.82%, SERVFAIL: 1.64%, NXDOMAIN: 30.55% |
| PowerDNS | 5.0.2   | 578/s  | 156ms       | 20 (0.04%)   | 86.5s    | NOERROR: 67.64%, SERVFAIL: 1.92%, NXDOMAIN: 30.43% |
| BIND     | 9.19.12 | 405/s  | 200ms       | 156 (0.31%)  | 123.0s   | NOERROR: 67.84%, SERVFAIL: 1.62%, NXDOMAIN: 30.54% |
| Unbound  | 1.17.1  | 338/s  | 237ms       | 263 (0.53%)  | 147.0s   | NOERROR: 68.20%, SERVFAIL: 1.20%, NXDOMAIN: 30.60% |

### Performance Summary

SDNS demonstrates superior performance across all key metrics:
- **Highest throughput**: 712 queries per second (23% faster than PowerDNS, 76% faster than BIND, 111% faster than Unbound)
- **Lowest latency**: 136ms average (13-43% lower than competitors)
- **Best reliability**: Only 2 lost queries out of 50,000 (99.996% success rate)
- **Fastest completion**: 70.2 seconds total runtime
