```

#### Pre-build Binaries

You can download the latest release from the [Github Repo](https://github.com/semihalev/sdns/releases/latest).

#### Docker

- [Docker Package](https://github.com/semihalev/sdns/packages/188181) (updated every release)
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/c1982/sdns) (alternative)

```shell
$ docker run -d --name sdns -p 53:53 -p 53:53/udp sdns
```

#### Docker Compose

Install `docker-compose` and run from the root directory:

```shell
$ sudo apt install docker-compose
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### Homebrew for macOS

Install and run as a service:

```shell

```shell
$ make test
```

## Flags

| Flag              | Desc                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -c, --config PATH | Location of the config file. If it doesn't exist, a new one will be generated. |
| -v, --version     | Show the version of the sdns.                                                  |
| -h, --help        | Show this help and exit.                                                       |

## Debugging Environment

To debug your environment, execute the following command:

```shell
$ export SDNS_DEBUGNS=true && export SDNS_PPROF=true && ./sdns
```

The `SDNS_DEBUGNS` environment variable is beneficial for verifying the RTT (Round Trip Time) of authoritative servers. To use it, send an HINFO query for zones with chaos class.

Here's an example of the output you might receive:

```shell
$ dig chaos hinfo example.com

; <<>> DiG 9.17.1 <<>> chaos hinfo example.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 29636

## Plugin Configuration

In sdns, you have the ability to add custom plugins. The sequence of the plugins and the middlewares has a mutual impact on their execution. Config keys must be strings, and values can be of any type. Plugins are loaded before the cache middleware in the specified order.

The plugin interface is straightforward. For additional information, please refer to the [example plugin](https://github.com/semihalev/sdnsexampleplugin).

### Example Configuration
```toml
[plugins]
     [plugins.example]
     path = "/path/to/exampleplugin.so"
     config = {key_1 = "value_1", intkey = 2, boolkey = true, keyN = "nnn"}
     [plugins.another]
     path = "/path/to/anotherplugin.so"
```
