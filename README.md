```

## Testing

```shell
$ make test
```

## Debug Environment

```shell
$ export SDNS_DEBUGNS=true && export SDNS_PPROF=true && ./sdns
```

SDNS_DEBUGNS enviroment useful when you want to check authoritive servers RTT times. 
Usage: send HINFO query for zones with chaos class.

Example Output:
```shell
$ dig chaos hinfo example.com

; <<>> DiG 9.17.1 <<>> chaos hinfo example.com

## Plugins Configuration

You can add your own plugins to sdns. The plugin order is very important. The orders of plugins and middlewares will effect each other. Config keys should be string and values can be anything. The plugins will load before cache middleware with their orders.

Plugin interface is very simple. For more information, you can look the [example plugin](https://github.com/semihalev/sdnsexampleplugin)

### Example Config
```toml
[plugins]
     [plugins.example]
     path = "/myplugindir/exampleplugin.so"
     config = {key_1 = "value_1",intkey = 2,boolkey = true,keyN = "nnn"}
     [plugins.another]
     path = "/myplugindir/anotherplugin.so"
```
